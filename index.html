            <h3>Abduction of Major Dalim</h3>
            <p>
                Sheikh Kamal is also accused of abducting Nimmi Dalim and her husband Shariful Haque Dalim (who later assassinated Sheikh Kamal and his family) from the Dhaka Ladies Club and taking them to the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini headquarters. Gazi Golam Mostafa and his two sons were also accused of being involved in this abduction. This was one of the reasons that Shariful Haque Dalim held a grudge against the Sheikh family.
